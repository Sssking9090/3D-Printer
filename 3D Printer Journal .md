# 3D Printer Build Journal

Total Time Spent: About 154+ hours  
Started: June 3, 2025

### Week 1 (6/3–6/9)

Starting from Scratch

Honestly, I had no clue how to even start building a 3D printer. So I jumped into research and watched a ton of YouTube videos, studied online models, and asked my dad for help to get the basics down. I learned about different printers like the Prusa, the Zidi Tech, and delta printers. But I didn’t do any CAD yet just looking up info and trying to figure out where to even begin. It was frustrating because everything was new and confusing, but I was determined to push through.

Time Spent: Around 26 hours

### Week 2 (6/10–6/16)

Diving into Onshape and Exploring Parts

This week, I finally started working with Onshape. Instead of making my own parts, I downloaded open-source models of motors, wheels, and other parts to study them. I was mostly just trying to understand how these parts worked and fit together. It was still tough as I didn’t really know where to start with the model. I tried drawing some rough ideas on paper, but honestly, they didn’t look good. Still, I kept going and learned a lot from just dissecting those models.

Time Spent: About 27 hours

### Week 3 (6/17–6/23)

Putting Pieces Together

This week I moved on to assembling the parts I downloaded into one big assembly. The tricky part was figuring out how to connect everything — the motors, linear rods, belts, pulleys — I was totally lost at times. I had to ask my family and friends a lot for help because I couldn’t wrap my head around it on my own. I also started working on the Hackpad as a side project. The progress felt slow, but I was starting to see the bigger picture.

Time Spent: Around 32 hours

### Week 4 (6/24–6/30)

Making Progress on the Assembly

This week felt easier because things started to click. I focused on the different parts of each axis and worked on connecting them in the assembly — linear rods, motor couplings, pulleys, and carriages. I found some helpful online printable models that inspired me and helped with measurements. Everything was starting to come together, and I was way less stuck than before. It still took a lot of trial and error, but I was finally making real progress.

### Week 5 (7/1–7/7)

Finishing the Model (Almost Broke My Brain)

I worked on finishing the whole model and started thinking about how the real build would go. I decided to keep the design as minimalistic as possible to avoid extra complications. But then I ran into a bunch of errors and problems such as parts didn’t fit right, constraints broke, and the whole thing felt like it was falling apart. There were moments I wanted to give up because it was so frustrating, but I pushed through and finished the model anyway. It was a huge relief to see everything completed.

Time Spent: About 20 hours

### Week 6 (7/8–7/14)

Fixing Errors and Battling the BOM

I spent this week fixing the errors I missed last week and making sure everything was solid and buildable. After that, I started the bill of materials and that was probably the hardest part yet. Finding the right parts online was such a pain. Many things weren’t available in the sizes I needed or were out of stock. I had to settle for bigger rails, aluminum plates that I would have to cut myself, and sometimes parts that just weren’t perfect. It took so much research and frustration, especially since I had a budget limit of $350. In the end, I decided to go for better quality parts even if it meant spending a bit more. The BOM isn’t 100% done yet, but I’m close, and I plan to finish it after submitting this round for funding.

### Summary

This whole project has been a huge learning experience. I started knowing nothing, struggled a lot, but kept pushing through the confusion and frustration. Now, I finally have a model that I’m proud of and a clear path to build it. I learned that research takes way longer than I expected, assemblies are tricky, and finding parts can be a nightmare. But the feeling of seeing everything come together is worth it. Can’t wait to get to the next phase\!
